# @flag --count                                 Print only on stdout the packet count when reading capture file(s) instead of parsing/printing the packets.
# @option -C <file_size>                        Before writing a raw packet to a savefile, check whether the file is currently larger than file_size and, if so, close the current savefile and open a new one.

# @flag -f                                      Print `foreign' IPv4 addresses numerically rather than symbolically (this option is intended to get around serious brain damage in Sun's NIS server â€” usually it hangs forever translating non-local internet numbers).

# @flag -U --packet-buffered                    If the -w option is not specified, or if it is specified but the --print flag is also specified, make the printed packet output ``packet-buffered''; i.e., as the description of the contents of each packet is printed, it will be written to the standard output, rather than, when not writing to a terminal, being written only when the output buffer fills.
# @flag -v                                      When parsing and printing, produce (slightly more) verbose output.

# @option -W <filecount>                        Used in conjunction with the -C option, this will limit the number of files created to the specified number, and begin overwriting files from the beginning, thus creating a 'rotating' buffer.
# @flag -x                                      When parsing and printing, in addition to printing the headers of each packet, print the data of each packet (minus its link level header) in hex.
# @flag -xx                                     When parsing and printing, in addition to printing the headers of each packet, print the data of each packet, including its link level header, in hex.
# @flag -X                                      When parsing and printing, in addition to printing the headers of each packet, print the data of each packet (minus its link level header) in hex and ASCII.
# @flag -XX                                     When parsing and printing, in addition to printing the headers of each packet, print the data of each packet, including its link level header, in hex and ASCII.
# @option -y --linktype <datalinktype>          Set the data link type to use while capturing packets (see -L) or just compiling and dumping packet-matching code (see -d) to datalinktype.
# @option -z <postrotate-command>               Used in conjunction with the -C or -G options, this will make tcpdump run " postrotate-command file " where file is the savefile being closed after each rotation.
# @option -Z --relinquish-privileges <user>     If tcpdump is running as root, after opening the capture device or input savefile, but before opening any savefiles for output, change the user ID to user and the group ID to the primary group of user.
