# @option --add-root <path>          See the corresponding option in nix-store.
# @flag --parse                      Just parse the input files, and print their abstract syntax trees on standard output as a Nix expression.
# @flag --eval                       Just parse and evaluate the input files, and print the resulting values on standard output.
# @flag --find-file                  Look up the given files in Nix’s search path (as specified by the NIX_PATH environment variable).
# @flag --strict                     When used with --eval, recursively evaluate list elements and attributes.
# @flag --json                       When used with --eval, print the resulting value as an JSON representation of the abstract syntax tree rather than as a Nix expression.
# @flag --xml                        When used with --eval, print the resulting value as an XML representation of the abstract syntax tree rather than as a Nix expression.
# @flag --read-write-mode            When used with --eval, perform evaluation in read/write mode so nix language features that require it will still work (at the cost of needing to do instantiation of every evaluated derivation).
# @flag --help                       Prints out a summary of the command syntax and exits.
# @flag --version                    Prints out the Nix version number on standard output and exits.
# @flag -v --verbose                 Increases the level of verbosity of diagnostic messages printed on standard error.
# @flag --quiet                      Decreases the level of verbosity of diagnostic messages printed on standard error.
# @option --log-format <format>      This option can be used to change the output of the log format, with format being one of:
# @flag -Q --no-build-output         By default, output written by builders to standard output and standard error is echoed to the Nix command’s standard error.
# @option -j --max-jobs <number>     Sets the maximum number of build jobs that Nix will perform in parallel to the specified number.
# @flag --cores                      Sets the value of the NIX_BUILD_CORES environment variable in the invocation of builders.
# @flag --max-silent-time            Sets the maximum number of seconds that a builder can go without producing any data on standard output or standard error.
# @flag --timeout                    Sets the maximum number of seconds that a builder can run.
# @flag -k --keep-going              Keep going in case of failed builds, to the greatest extent possible.
# @flag -K --keep-failed             Specifies that in case of a build failure, the temporary directory (usually in /tmp) in which the build takes place should not be deleted.
# @flag --fallback                   Whenever Nix attempts to build a derivation for which substitutes are known for each output path, but realising the output paths through the substitutes fails, fall back on building the derivation.
# @flag --readonly-mode              When this option is used, no attempt is made to open the Nix database.
# @option --arg <name> <value>       This option is accepted by nix-env, nix-instantiate, nix-shell and nix-build.
# @option --argstr <name> <value>    This option is like --arg, only the value is not a Nix expression but a string.
# @option -A --attr <attrPath>       Select an attribute from the top-level Nix expression being evaluated.
# @flag -E --expr                    Interpret the command line arguments as a list of Nix expressions to be parsed and evaluated, rather than as a list of file names of Nix expressions.
# @option -I --include <path>        Add an entry to the list of search paths used to resolve lookup paths.
# @option --option <name> <value>    Set the Nix configuration option name to value.
# @flag --repair                     Fix corrupted or missing store paths by redownloading or rebuilding them.
