# @cmd Clone a repository into a new directory
# @flag -l --local                               When the repository to clone from is on a local machine, this flag bypasses the normal "Git aware" transport mechanism and clones the repository by making a copy of HEAD and everything under objects and refs directories.
# @flag --no-hardlinks                           Force the cloning process from a repository on a local filesystem to copy the files under the .git/objects directory instead of using hardlinks.
# @flag -s --shared                              When the repository to clone is on the local machine, instead of using hard links, automatically setup .git/objects/info/alternates to share the objects with the source repository.
# @option --reference <-if-able> <repository>    If the reference repository is on the local machine, automatically setup .git/objects/info/alternates to obtain objects from the reference repository.
# @flag --dissociate                             Borrow the objects from reference repositories specified with the --reference options only to reduce network transfer, and stop borrowing from them after a clone is made by making necessary local copies of borrowed objects.
# @flag -q --quiet                               Operate quietly.
# @flag -v --verbose                             Run verbosely.

# @option -u --upload-pack <upload-pack>         When given, and the repository to clone from is accessed via ssh, this specifies a non-default path for the command run on the other end.
# @option --template <template_directory>        Specify the directory from which templates will be used; (See the "TEMPLATE DIRECTORY" section of git-init(1).)
# @option -c --config <<key>=<value>>            Set a configuration variable in the newly-created repository; this takes effect immediately after the repository is initialized, but before the remote history is fetched or any files checked out.

# @flag --no-single-branch                       Clone only the history leading to the tip of a single branch, either specified by the --branch option or the primary branch remote’s HEAD points at.
# @flag --no-tags                                Don’t clone any tags, and set remote.<remote>.tagOpt=--no-tags in the config, ensuring that future git pull and git fetch operations won’t follow any tags.

# @flag --remote-submodules                      All submodules which are cloned will use the status of the submodule’s remote-tracking branch to update the submodule, rather than the superproject’s recorded SHA-1.
# @flag --no-remote-submodules                   All submodules which are cloned will use the status of the submodule’s remote-tracking branch to update the submodule, rather than the superproject’s recorded SHA-1.
# @option --separate-git-dir <git dir>           Instead of placing the cloned repository where it is supposed to be, place the cloned repository at the specified directory, then make a filesystem-agnostic Git symbolic link to there.

# @option --refmap <refspec>                 When fetching refs listed on the command line, use the specified refspec (can be given more than once) to map the refs to remote-tracking branches, instead of the values of remote.*.fetch configuration variables for the remote repository.
# @flag -t --tags                            Fetch all tags from the remote (i.e., fetch remote tags refs/tags/* into local tags with the same name), in addition to whatever else would otherwise be fetched.

# @flag --cherry                                  A synonym for --right-only --cherry-mark --no-merges; useful to limit the output to the commits on our side and mark those that have been applied to the other side of a forked history with git log --cherry upstream...mybranch, similar to git cherry upstream mybranch.
