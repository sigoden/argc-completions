## Setup

### 1. clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/sigoden/argc-completions.git
```

### 2. install required tools

Argc-completions requires the following tools:

- [argc](https://github.com/sigoden/argc): completion engine

./scripts/setup-shell.sh fish
./scripts/setup-shell.sh nushell
./scripts/setup-shell.sh powershell
./scripts/setup-shell.sh xonsh
./scripts/setup-shell.sh zsh

argc generate your-command # or ./scripts/generate.sh your-command
```
